## PONG


Pong , developped as an arcade game in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first ever successful video game. It was in- spired by the very first video game, Tennis for Two , developped in 1958 by William Higinbotham on an oscilloscope.

The goal of this project is to work on a 3d version of this game (or of the Brick Break game by the way...) ; only one bat will be considered, moving only in the 0-altitude plan (which happens to be (Oxy)).

How it work :

**x0** ball abscissa at time t−1

**y0** ball ordinate at time t−1

**z0** ball altitude at time t−1

**x1** ball abscissa at time t

**y1** ball ordinate at time t

**z1** ball altitude at time t

**n** time shift (greater than or equal to zero, integer)
